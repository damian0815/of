[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ofnode/of.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ofnode/of)


Features
--------

 - 64-bit, CMake, Ninja, Cotire, Clang and Sanitize ready.

 - Generate project file for your favorite IDE with [CMake Generators](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#extra-generators).
 
 - Easily add [openFrameworks addons](http://ofxaddons.com) with single `ofxaddon` command.


Difference
----------

The only difference is that this project targets CMake build system and stores source code of some libraries on which openFrameworks depends locally with patches applied if needed.

See [Architecture](https://github.com/ofnode/of/wiki/Architecture) wiki page for details.


Step 1: Clone
-------------

Run `git clone https://github.com/ofnode/of --depth 1 --no-single-branch` to clone repo.

Step 2: Prepare
---------------

Install required developer packages for your OS with:

#### Linux:

[`dev/install/linux`](https://github.com/ofnode/of/tree/master/dev/install/linux) distro script

#### OS X:

[`dev/install/osx/homebrew.sh`](https://github.com/ofnode/of/tree/master/dev/install/osx/homebrew.sh)

#### Windows:

### [See wiki](https://github.com/ofnode/of/wiki/Instructions-for-Windows)


Step 3: Compile
---------------

For Linux, OS X and Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

For Raspberry Pi 2, pass `-DOF_PLATFORM=armv7` and `-j3` flags to `cmake` and `ninja` respectively:

```
cmake .. -G Ninja -DOF_PLATFORM=armv7
ninja -j3
```

Also, you can generate project files for IDEs, Xcode example:

```bash
cmake .. -G Xcode -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
xcodebuild -configuration Release
```

**NOTE**: Visual Studio is not supported anymore, [see here why](https://github.com/ofnode/of/wiki/On-removing-support-for-MSVC).
